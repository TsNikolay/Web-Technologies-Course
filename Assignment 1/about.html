                    <p>I'm a programmer because I enjoy creating <strong>digital solutions</strong> to real problems. I work 
                        primarily with the <strong>MERN stack</strong> and have experience in <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>Python</strong>. I have also worked with <u>C</u>, <u>Ada</u>, and even <u>Assembler</u>, 
                        which has given me strong adaptability and versatility in my technical approach.

                    <p>I am a <strong>student of software engineering</strong>, with a strong focus on <em>web development</em> and <em>game 
                        development</em> as hobbies. Although I have no direct work experience, my academic background and dedication to <strong>independent projects</strong> have provided me with a solid foundation.

                    <p>My philosophy: <q><strong>If you're going to do something, do it well. If you can't, it's best not to do it at all.</strong></q> 
                        This reflects my commitment to <em>quality</em> in everything I do.

                    <p>Alongside technical skills, I bring valuable <strong>soft qualities</strong> like <u>leadership</u>, an ability to find common ground, and a focus on <em>positive relationships</em>.

                    <p>What inspires me most is knowing <strong>my work has value</strong>. Outside work, I am an <u>avid gamer</u>, enjoy puzzles, and write songs. A guiding principle for me is: <q><em>“Success is the ability to go from 
                        failure to failure without losing enthusiasm.”</em></q> This philosophy keeps me resilient and constantly growing.
